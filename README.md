# How To compile the source code

## Windows Project Setup Instructions

### 1. Install latest Python 3
- Run the [latest Python 3 installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- During installation, make sure to:
  - **Use administrator privileges** when installing Python
  - **Add `python.exe` to the system PATH**
  - Select any other appropriate options as prompted

### 2. Open a Windows Command Prompt and install all dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
python -m pip install --upgrade pyinstaller
python -m pip install --upgrade requests lxml python-dateutil PyQt5
```
or simply: 
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Verify that PyInstaller is installed correctly

```bash
pyinstaller --version
# Example of expected output: 6.15.0
```

### 4. Final Setup
- Run the [build_iptv_player.bat](build_iptv_player.bat) file to start the process.

## Rocky9/RHEL9 Project Setup Instructions

### 1. Install latest Python 3
- To compile Python yourself, download the [source code](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/)
- Tested with Python 3.13.4\
 _Note:_  The following dependencies must be installed:\
`sudo dnf install python3-devel xcb-util-wm xcb-util-image xcb-util-keysyms xcb-util-renderutil xcb-util-xinerama`\
\
If you are building Python from source, you may need additional build dependencies and should build with the `--enable-shared` flag (or `--enable-framework` on macOS).

### 2. Open a Terminal and install all dependencies

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pyinstaller
python3 -m pip install --upgrade requests lxml python-dateutil PyQt5
```
_Note:_ If you are not logged in as root (which is recommended), you need to ensure that `pyInstaller` is included in your PATH environment variable:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
```

### 3. Verify that PyInstaller is installed correctly

```bash
pyinstaller --version
# Example of expected output: 6.14.0
```

### 4. Final Setup
- Make the SH script executable with the command:\
`chmod +x build_iptv_player.sh`
- Run the [./build_iptv_player.sh](build_iptv_player.sh) file to start the process.

## Debian/Ubuntu Project Setup Instructions

### 1. Install System Dependencies
- It is recommended to use the system's Python 3.
- The following dependencies must be installed for building the application:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-dev libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-render-util0 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-image0
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment and Install Python Packages

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools pyinstaller
python3 -m pip install --upgrade requests lxml python-dateutil PyQt5
```

### 3. Verify that PyInstaller is installed correctly

```bash
pyinstaller --version
# Example of expected output: 6.14.0
```

### 4. Final Setup
- Make the SH script executable with the command:\
`chmod +x build_iptv_player.sh`
- Run the ./build_iptv_player.sh file to start the process.
